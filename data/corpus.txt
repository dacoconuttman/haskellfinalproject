Nice, no distance, nights, night vision

Night vision in my armor, yeah, I took it over
Watching Space Jam, Lean's never sober
Stunting with my team, is your baby's mama dream
I'm so icy, I'm so clean, Sad Boys, and Yung Lean
Drive a body down in my Range Rover
Trying to calm it down like I'm Oprah
Police knocking on my window
But it's like I told ya, soon as they approach us
Squash 'em like cock roaches

[Hook]

Sad Boys season, I'm in space for a reason
Coke on my clothes, counting stacks up in Sweden
My trees spent, let me, let me get me some
Three headed dolphin, it's the threesome
Lean, lean and Hennessy and sprite
With the cheese and the Mac to your back
Make you believe in religion
Found upon gods in the season, Sad Boys season
Digimon, plane crashes, smoke hash til the ashes
Vietnam flashes
Ecstasy in the glass
Iced out patches on my scars, but it's rashes
Digimon plane crashes, smoke hash til the ashes
Vietnam flashes

Eat her out, wipe my face with a serviette
Rich, feeling legs
Creeping in the cut, with a Tommy gun
I'ma stomp on your fondue
Face looking like Scooby Doo, the groovy one
Cannibus, anthrax, paid fast, get stacks
Count racks, cash checks, and all that
Bad breath, LSD right, creeping 'round like a lab rat
Eat her out, kit kat
Shorty we can take it real slow, if you wanna
Sex and pills, Lean got the marijuana

Little chain explosive, I'm fast, I'm C-4
Wake up in the morning and I'm married to a dinosaur
Her vagina's sore
Click clack click like the liquor store
Living life like we in Baltimore
Tell the preacher it's a folklore
What, for? What, for?
Switched out the Ferrari from the double door
Smoking Sherman like I'm Dumbledore
Humble, poor
Hungry hippos and we finna rob the liquor store
And we finna rob the liquor store
Lean got plenty more

Swerving swerving on this iced tea

"Am I awake?", I got to check
Went to sleep, then I came back
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back, PCP attack
Greedy pills hoes, on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotion boys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario
Sad Boys blast your stereos
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin dough, Ho I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio

Lean Doer dresses slicker
I'm so iced out that it's Winter
Destroy my stupid liver

Never hesitate, shit, to pull the trigger
Luxurious, ate before my dinner, throw Bombay down the river
Yea, you get that picture
Gold and silver around my finger
Shorty on that West Side, she a gold digger, wake up
And I'm a winner, showering in five star
Ho take that look in the mirror, I'm on my grind

Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind,

Sad boys they be shining shining
Focus on whining whining
When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying

Why do I gotta be alive
I ain't about that life I ain't bout that life
Fuck all of y'all no one can tell me shit
I'm with my team I'm so high please get up off my dick
I love nature and everything around me
But when an eye press into find me
I'm on the floor crying, crying
Sad boys says that I'm dying, dying

[Hook]

Rocks got me chipping
Pussy starts a-dripping
I might just have to slip in
Grey Goose sipping
Pink skies got me tripping
Never catch me slippin', never catch me slippin'
High-tec polo gear sipping
Up that Jack when I'm in Narashino flipping
Sushi bars after bars catch me whipping

Glock in my Gucci belt got you equipping
Anime shawtys be stripping

No you never get me slipping

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.
All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to die

Smoking on some sour
In Bahamas
Wearing Green Polo Pajamas
Made of marijuana
Fuck an ugly ho
Like Johnny Drama
Licking off dripping champagne from my fingernail
Tripping off ginger-ale
This tune ain't got no hook
Like a hunky tail
Me and pedram on this bitch, we're in aventail
On the beach, with the pink polo, the color of rose
Dirty stinking feet
Started drinking whiskey neat
Already drinken' three
Yung Lean is that curly-haired freak
Take a seat
Got a new passport eating lobster in court
Teleport to a new time zone with an escort
Got a fort, filled with hoes who just want to snort
Take a boat to my resort, in Hawaii
Where I got a tennis court
I forgot to mention that I still get child support

Drinking forties out in Honolulu
With my shawty and she's siftin' on chicken pu-pu
I'm in doo-doo, hoes sucking nuts but this ain't no chippendales
Drifting fails off a drifting tale
Made of minimum wage
Starring in shit movies like Nicolas Cage
I'm drinking a pina colada in the plage
Inhale exhale fuck a female, throw stones on madlib backstage

[Hook:]
I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs
Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures
[?] stitches
Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling [?]
Till my hand starts twitching, twitching
Y'all think I'm so weird, I ain't really human I'm revered
Couldn't give less fucks about my career
Posted in a spaceship showing no fear
No one heard about Lean a month ago, ago
I was in my bedroom making music, yo
I make no sense, I make nonsense
Should've played in the window from my Benz
Stunting all you haters, I jumped over the fence
Jumped over the chase, jumped up the top of her
With my AK-47 in the face
Take you back to heaven, it's a race
Counting stacks, smoking [?]
Bey Bey-blades [?]

I can buy you lemonade, I can buy you drugs
Arizona tears, Arizona tears
Arizona tears, Arizona tears

Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her
Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures
[?] stitches
Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling [?]
Till my hand starts twitching, twitching

Walk in my shoes you'll see why
Fuck everyone, I don’t reply

You could try and look for me
But you could never find me
Get behind me

I’m smoking burnt tires
I got spirit flowers wasting money every hour
You don’t like me, you a liar
I’m a-I’m a sacrificer
Get my palace like I’m Malice

All I do is get higher, never tired
You can’t touch me, cause I’m made of wire

Delete my number, never call me back
Flat on the ground spat blood on my Acronym bag
We from Stocktown, seasons change
Bitch you know where we at

[Hook x2]

[Travi$ Scott:]
Let's get real, land of the ghost, so trill
Come and take a trip in my hill, get ghost
Don't come up here with that shit, get roast
Know LaFlame don't play by his toast, you know
And I'm bound to flow you down, come on, she grab my jeans
She grab the kush, she balancing on my balance beam
While I'm jigglin' cantaloupes
We off that lean, lean, lean in my dream, dream, dream, dreams
We don't want alcohol drinks, only soda and codeine
Get it right, get it right
It ain't down for the night, it ain't down for the night
A-yo yo yo Lean where these bitches come from
Tryna' see who with the shits, who really down to get drunk
I might throw up, might turn up, turn up of every summer
Every summer, every summer, every summer

[Travi$ Scott:]
I'm with sad boys in Stockholm they know H-town be my home
They know H-Town be my home
Them, them my homies, them, them my homies
I'm with Sad Boys in Stockholm
They know Mo City my home
Them them my homies, them them my homies
Them them my motherfucking homies
(Straight up)

[Hook x5]

[Chorus:]
I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything who am I to blame
Stand like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands, I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city of my mind nothing matters anymore it's just a matter of time
Until we fall back and meet again feed my needs again
Posted with my friends I resurrect to rise again

They call me crazy at least they talking straight
Shock first so they listen now that’s my faith
Cop a real estate out in winterland made it out
Bless my fate
Just be you it's never too late
All I do is great
Sprinkle the hash let me live fast
Show up last with the biggest bands
Least love for the biggest fans
I'm a weirdo so to the weirdos I give back
Roses in my bathtub, leave your blood in a black mug
Used to be a hobby now it's all I think about
That's what rap does
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers I don't work for no one
Moving through the city and I just begun
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers I don't work for no one
Moving through the city, Yung Lean SBE just begun

[Chorus x2]

Heart, heart, heart of a lion, lion
Heart departed from my soul, thanks to everyone who hates me, only makes me fit my role
I got orange juice and doobies, I'll be tourin troops, and groupies
Chef fired, vampire, diamonds, diamonds, i got rupees, i got pills in my smoothies
SBE, Just some loonies
Move like gang hit the scene with my trueies
Money, money in my bank account
You know I've gotta spend it all
Flick the lighter's light
If I die you'll never see me fall
Fuck the police, til the, til the, til the curtain call
Ball? No, basketball, New shoes, bank calls
Mix it with some alcohol, Adderalls, 'till I fall
Not supposed to make it so we chase it till we got em all
Made it, did it, out of zero[?], flipped it, got it, made a hero
Fuck the game, I've been a year old[?], faster than you like De Niro
If you don't like me, get the fuck out my face
I'm ridin' in a starship, get the fuck out my way

[Hook:]
The key and the gate it's a leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
The key and the gate it's a leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
I see her

I see her
At the back of the club with my boys blowing dub
We don't talk, don't show love, white shoes, white gloves
Dark night, end of
You got dro? lots of
In the sky, like a dove I wanna die and reach above
I never lie, as I seek of the one who walked out of my life, I can’t get a hold of
SBE is who you speak of, I wanna be the one who you speak of, the one who you dream of
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love

[Hook]

Thinking bout what once was and how I should have done it better smoking drugs till I'm reckless
Now I'm wrecked and you miss me like I reckon
Snow White coke imma die as a legend
Never felt threatened, we used to be peasants
Me and my boys blowing up like nuclear weapons
Spray painted heaven
My shit together the whole world infected
Only the fans get it, I see my reflection get my money, then I check in
You’re blessed by my presence, I just died and I checked in to heaven
To heaven

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, lay me down
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her, I see her
Sandman, CEO
SBE, cash man
Damn man, Shawty got it bad with her last man
Fat pants, big diamonds, sipping jasmine
Roll up to the mountain and I'm dripping all black man
True friends only roll with true friends
Green tea, straight out the tin can
Think man, reminisce on what has, has been, hash man
Throw my conscious in the trash can, trash man
That is what they said I'd be, it's has been a good year
It's is time to raise the glass man
Cops man, fuck the police, let them blast them down
Fattens, all my money fattens
What the hell happened Fishscale salmon
Hop on the bandwagon
All I do is golden, work more then Safran
Plasma's, all my TV's plasma's
Patterns, you can see the patterns in my passion
Only role companions
Wonderland, I'm in Wonderland like I'm Alice
My palace, is going to fast, let me fasten seat belt
Loui V, can you imagine
MDMA, no Montana
Let me bring this back to land man
Abandoned, leave you abandoned
Fuck with me and you know we leave you abandoned
Let me bring this back to land man, it's has been a good year, bitch it's time to raise the glass man

[Repeats half of verse]

[Hook:]
Hold up cause I gotta roll up
Doin' donuts Euro don't fold up
Four blunts on the road for four months
I don't like takin' pictures please ignore us
I'm abnormal, Gargamel cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

Welcome to my corridor
Feelin' like a Warlord
Exoskeleton, I became a martyr
Mexico by night if you wanna take a charter
Grind a little harder
Snow white seven dwarves, chains on baller
10 black bottles with my boys overseas
Cadillac's like melted cheese
Money in my time machine
Went to China set me free
Silver screens on silver screens
Chandeliers I make believe
I just do, as I please
Sippin' lean as I sleep
Countin' money like a sheep
Baddest bitch on the side of me
She go
Cause she know
It's all that I need
Cause she know
Cause she go
All my trees
Look like seeds
Feelin' so immortal (Lean!)
Feelin' like a Warlord
My Breeze, my chain, my watch
Make you freeze
My Breeze, my chain, my watch
Make you freeze

[Hook:]
Hold up cause I gotta roll up
Doin' donuts Euros don't fold up
Four blunts on the road for four months
I don't like takin' pictures please ignore us
I'm abnormal, Gargamel cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

Tryna tell me something, I don't listen
I don't pay attention to these children
R-R-R-Runnin' off the highway on a mission
I see green lights, mis-misfits smokin' cannabis
THC bliss, I'm a thug , you a counterfeit
Draped in silk, but I ain't pay shit for this outfit
Saw you in the lobby once, robin jeans, my wings were off
Don't fuck with me, I'm Hulk Hogan
You saw my face, but I'm soo dumb

[Hook - Yung Lean:]
I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll-
I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

Yeah I got the knife, I don't wanna use it tonight
Let the stars decide if I'm gonna live or die
Gonna lose my mind, running running through the night
Creeping up outside with my team you know I'm high
Pull up wth no lights, blowing smoke, drinking ice
What's your blood type, what does it taste like?
Riding on my bike, rain this rain is coming down
All my boys can fly, we're like angels in the night

I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

Louis, gucci, polo, I rock all that shit everyday
Catch me in a four door with yung sherman, hop out in LA
Buildings fallin' down, I need money, I need mine today
You could do all you like, I know I'm stuck up in my ways
I woke up in a gucci linen bed, I'm feelin' fine today
Make it rain, I make it burn, take my chances, take my turn
Runnin' up the highway on a mission, runnin' up the highway on a mission
Yung Leandoer
Shawty you know what it do
2015, MIA
Skurtttt

[Hook:]
Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan

Cause I keep that kush from Afghanistan, and I smoke that OG
I'm fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold
I'm a cannon, I'mma blow, 30 genes, I'm a bodyguard
I'll take ya to the cold, yeah, I'mma take ya to the cold

Get glass interior, yeah I broke the barrier
I don't want that shawty, yeah, you should go and marry her
I'm on my cellular, we rollin' Jheri curls
Yeah, I'm elegant for the hell of it
Roll that shit, water it, like efficient, sell that shit
12 a bag, 12 a bitch, acne jeans, I'm on my shit
Sewer cup, double up, james bond, hit her up
Hit 'em up, fuck my guts, I'm in it for the fuckin' lunch
Captain crunch, blowin' bubble gum, pimple drawn a hunt
Mind off in maniac, money on my mind
Had to leave that place, couldn't take it at the time
Now I'm on my fuckin' grind, yeah I'm on my fuckin' grind

[Hook x2]

I'm fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold
See I'm fucked, I roll kush from Afghanistan
Fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold
See I'm fucked, I roll kush from Afghanistan

(Leandoer!)

I don't want to hurt you
Movin' 'round in circles
Will do if I have to
All I do is work you
I got Gs on Gs like burgers
Move it 'round like lurkers
I lost all my urges
Pink polo, paint a circus
Insert money, insert through
Life is like a drive thru
I guess I could die soon
I feel like a typhoon
Smell like weed and perfume
Smurf, blue pills like swirls
All I smoke is herbal
Products, them be purple
Mail box clean, Donald Duck lungs
I need a million dollars, not some bucks, son
Duck 1, duck 2, paint a truck, son
When we roll up, Gucci mags on my truck, son
We'll come from pop anthrax
Air max, we got 10 stacks
I be smokin' tear gas
Percocet, that's a fear fact
Yeah, I got my gear back
Don't hold tears from years back
Talking, we don't hear that

Fuckin' up, we don't hear that
I'm smokin' on nitrous oxide
Holdin' shit down, I got mine
My eyes red just like a stop sign
I'm number 1, not no top 5
I'm blood gang, cap gang, 4l
Pills, weed, molly, xanax for sale
Got shooters out South, you don't know well
They'll pull up right to your doorbell
I'm too iced out, I'm a snowman
Oh, ride in the foreign get low ragged
I'm out in Chiraq where it's cold at
Went two nights and blow caps
Yea, glo gang I own that
Pull up on your block, blow your skull cap
And I ain't really wit no romance
Cause I'm too busy callin' up the dope man
Shooters all on my roster
The whole team tryna get sponsored
I'm jumpin' shit, Travis Barker
Your blunt is like a pencil, mines a marker, whaa
And I see you're a talker
So to shut ya ass up will be a motherfuckin' honor
It's me and Yung Lean, no receipts
Smokin' dope even though it's some shrimp and lobster
Whaa

[Hook:]
Leeaaann
Fattest bag around, tell the law when I don’t fuck with
The saddest firm around, turn to dogs if they barkin' on me
Bag filled with white life, let’s throw it in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up, bet my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

Two dead rats and I see a gallon
Got alotta shit in my bag like Santa
Bitches see me, hoes gettin' tantrum
Rockstar person, I'm like Marilyn Manson
Dirt on my face, bitches think I'm handsome
18, but my money likes expansion
Me and my boys, we just styled in Aspen
After breakfast, people call us madmen
I've always been this way and I call them hasbeens
Never gave a fuck it's like it never mattered
Accept the actions, forget the sad shit
Blowin' smoke in your face, became a dragon
Money in my right and my left hand
Ridin' on a horse with a dead man
Xans in my left hand

[Hook]

Fattest bag around, tell the law when I don’t fuck with
The saddest firm around turn to dogs if they barkin' on me
Bag filled with white life, let’s throw it in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up, bet my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris
It's ain't even my fault though?
Fire
F-f-f-f-fire
Fire
F-f-f-f-fire

Flames, fire and a buyer
Cause you know I got that fire, yung leandoer can't expire
We walked in this, they sound like a choir
Bitch I'm smokin' spirit flowers
Cause you know it takes me higher
My money speedin' no flat tire
Over on this side it is drier
Louis Vuitton sheets with flowers
Helicopters round the windows
Now I'm sippin' everything slow
You would think i said that in the intro
I'm ridin' past you in that limo
Sadboy gang we some heroes
Money bitches like flamingos
Riding past you in that limo
Xans on me, oh lord
I stick my head out the window

Fuck school, it made me sick
All of my haters, they make me rich
They warned me about this shit
I'mma do this till I go extinct
Bitches, just know that its yung leandoer
Straight from the sewer posted with Bladee Krueger
Hit him and get him, I stack 'em, I rip 'em
Just like my stacks, I got cash in my denim
Salvation, bitch I need my medication (meds)
Sadboy gang, bitch we one nation (GBE)
Posted up celebrating, takin' flights like vacation
Paper chasin', I keep 'em waitin'
Bitch, you know that I keep 'em waitin'

Fire, I'mma still live in the fire
Yung leandoer can't expire
We walked in this, they sound like a choir
Cause you know I got that fire
Way up
Way up
Some up

[Hook:]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
Forever, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, around someway up

Nitrous oxide, I've seen the world collide
I lost count of all the times, she ask me why
Ma-ma-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise
All my, all my, boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life
Fire flames, color red, 'member recent times
Stacks of shoes, got soo many, don't really the 'mount
When it's hot outside, I copped me some ice
Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes
Mix it with fanta, not with sprite, wings from Calvin Klein
Forever I'll fly, all the times I remind, cause some way...
Way high up in the sky
I got a white shirt and a tangerine belt
In a winter where the snow don't melt
Cause I keep to myself
Cause I keep to myself

[Hook]

I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
Forever, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, around someway up
Pull up in that Veyron goin' skrt-skrt
Everyday shit fuck what you heard-heard
I'm so high that I'm flyin' like a bird-bird
All of that I know is that it's her-her
I, I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer
Draped in that Gucci scarf my phone going berserk
I don't do no eye contact my vision blurred-blurred
I'm a demon like a fur-fur, they think I'm absurd-surd
But when I enter the galaxy they are li-like word-word
I'm too fucked up, she said when I heard her
I don't have no feelings left, I don't wanna hurt her
I am surfing on the earth I'm a surfer
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down
I don't need your help
I just popped a pill I can't control myself
I'm in that forest and my life is like a fairy tale
Diamonds in my veins, I'm sipping ginger ale
Hate in my heart, getting guided by elves
I'm a lion in this shit everyone else is stale
Smoke still coming out my mouth when I exhale
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down, I don't need you help
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well


[Hook:]
Shawty, roll up, I'm a smoker
We will fly high they below us
Bitch, Im runnin' on the road to the money bus
My wings fold up, smokin' winter lungs
My boys roll up, rollin' honey buns
I got pills look like rainbows in my tour bus
More cash, more stacks and there's more for us
Money foreign in my pocket and it's for us

I got bucks in my louis bags, bags under my eyes
Lean up in the club I'm smoking winnin gettin fried
Fuck these other guys Imma do this till I die
Pink polo dirty stacks 24/7, 9-5
I need a new ring and i need another pill
Still in Yoshi City rollin rollin down a hill
I need a new high and I need a new life
I need a hundred million roses on me when I die

[Hook]

For us, for us
More stacks for us

[Hook]

For us, for us

Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?

B-bitch named Lean, Emperor of the city
Silver rings on, sitting on 50
Blowing on Winter, icy like a stunner
Looking like Winter, temperature like the summer
Chain like a seahorse, Is that really Leandoer?
All white Dior, all I wear is Dior
Catch me on my samsung, SBE anthem
I be in the night creeping round' like the phantom

[Hook]

Airbrushed, Air ice like I’m 19
Light speed, colour, lime green look like ice cream
Light beam, call it light stream or you’ll white beam
Five keys or my eyes bleed on the Nikes
Headlock, scope red dot, It’s a head shot
Shell shock, do the air-drop, I got dead stock
Flow like purple drugs sprite, that's my blood type
I wish none of this was real life, but it's sunlight
You don't know what I'm up to
We don't talk about it 'less you do
Got a fight crew, we sky team
Shoot around town, got bad dreams
It’s weed and purple we up to
Just got a bunch of em’ Nike shoes
For I make big money, my own crew too
We the Sadboys and we’ll fuck you

[Hook]

[Hook:]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a range rover
Is my life over?

Take, take, take, take
Take control of, take control of me
Take control of lean, take control of me
All I roll is potent

White powder like a hill, take control of me
When it hits my body, you know there's no stoppin' lean
I don't like red, paint the roses green
Put a price up on my head, there's no controllin' me
I thought I was dead, but I'm livin' free
Walk up in the spot, bitch, it's SBE
Stack the money green, turn it into leaves
Six Air Force on my feet look like a centipede

[Hook]


Never will I rise to fall, I've seen that light from very far
I pack my bag, I pack my bag, bet you could never match the stars
Keep my boys 'round, they watch my back
Follow the lights, we in the cab
Hash is from uzbekistan, I ball like asics 'cross the land
You see my face, I see your hands
She don't want to understand, but I have a plan
Mixing alcohol and xans, when I'm with my gang
You can find me where I stand, Disney wonderland
I don't ever get attached, doesn't work like that
Doesn't work like that
Black bracelet, never show facesTwo pills runnin' round in the matrix
Never show faces, never show faces
Two pills runnin' round in the matrix

[Hook x2]

[Hook:]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrist links when I come through

I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, paint it true
Shawty, you know what it do

Smokin' double, give me two
Shawty, you know what it do
I don't give no fucks 'bout you
I take it all, can never lose
Only myself for my trues
Lovin' this shit since I was two
Got helicopters on my roof
I'm hiding far away from you
Sad Mob, we don't fuck wit fools
I’m in the snow sipping Grey Goose
Double Gs on my shoe
Gs on my shoes

[Hook]

I'm not looking for you

[Hook:]
Pop, pop, pop, drop this top, top, top

I dont give a motherfuck, watchin' starwars smokin' pot
I take what I got, I live till it stops
Chop, chop chop, all my lungs stay rot
I take what I got, you hate that you're not
Like me and me I don't give a motherfuck
What I am, what I'm not, polo down to my socks

What person, they can't stop, I fly to the top
F-f-fuck what you got, I'm off a pill, rollin' like a rock
White diamonds countin' guap, I got marble on my watch
I got slam doors out the front, I'll keep goin' till I'm out
I got pockets like the plug, I'm movin' 'round all day
Fade to grey, everythin' can't stay
I smoke so much, went away
I'm in leanworld, l-l-let my mind stay
Whichever today, I love my brothers, we gon' slay

I'm not for you
I'm not for you

I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth
You think you hate me, I know that it hurts
Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn
Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn
I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth
You think I hate you, I know that it hurts
I burned, burned, burned, my turn, turn, turns

Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up, in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow

I got an empire of emotional
Squad see me crusin', crusin' in my go kart
I'm War ho, I'm Warhol
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts
Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola Veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadow
A tad too close
Rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose
Too weird for them other fuccbois
Catch Lean and sad boys
Out in Europe, sippin' cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bur
Don't close your eyes
And lean back though
Ya'll ain't ready for the lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean
Yunging with my Team
Pumping RZA eating pizza
Man I'm living my dreams

(Fuck your bitch in the mouth)

[Hook x2]

My life I've comprehended, it's not a lie
I'm dependent on my team
When I send it, I spit fire I'm an element
I’m everything
You're irrelevant
Take it easy
Yeah we getting it
BBC pants yeah I’m getting rich
All this love I'm melting it
Don’t let me down I’m not meant for it
If you ask me, I might come for it
I'll take back to the rain forest
My heart and soul, yeah you tore it
I don't want to be here, but my lives more of it
There's more of it
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest
See me on the bus, blowing sesh
Nothing less, we the best
Fuck the rest
Water in my lungs
Finna quest
I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt
Too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn
See, see that's my firm
Nike, Nike on my shirt
Bubbles bubbles, blowing bubbles
But I guess they'll never burst
Empire of my state of mind
I'mma do me, I'mma make it mine
I say fuck the shine
I say fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind
I'm hard to find

[Hook/Outro x3]


Nursery rhymes, I'm rehearsing zero times
We just two dimes, baseball bats, busting signs
Do it from behind
The devil is inside me I can see his face sometimes
When the sun shines, spliff in my hand
His face only comes up at night time

When there's no one left around
Find Yung Leandoer under cover
Not making a single sound
Tired of lingering round
Hire for bitching around
What comes around never comes back down
And I never back down
When it's time to face Lucifer face to face when the time runs out
And It's I & I against the red clown

Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note:
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat
[x2]

Love rains down on me
Yung Lean, the unseen

Treat her like a prostitute
Drinking margarita from a boot
Fucking bitches mute
She can't understand me but I think she's kinda cute
Her secret chamber looks like a fleshy fruit
Got a Leandoer base filled with nudes
This is my new recruit
You could try to multiply all you want, you're still a square root
I'm a preserver but dryin' like a dried fruit
She's on the couch watching Beavis and Butthead in her birthday suit
Drinking champagne flute
Salute

Come out the toilet, with vomit on my sweater
Lean fucking hoes heads, who can do it better?
Blood written love letters
Her body waste secretes
Who fucking fed her?
Don't touch my Cheetos, she can have some cheddar
Cause I'll let her
Tell 'em Lean sent her back to the basement
Where the clocks on backwards
And everybody's back hurts from carrying AK47s from the pavement
This is a bold statement

Shove a crucifix and a rope down your throat
Lucifer is watching in a rowing boat
Lower note
Let's see what I got inside my black coat
A black rope and a black goat
[x2]
